  ## [Description](#table-of-contents)

  This project is a way to generate an SVG logo based on 4 prompts answered by the user. The shape, the color of the shape, the text within the shape, and the color of the text. This was an exercise on Object Oriented Programming. Someone might use this application to easily create their own SVG logo within seconds.
